An Essay on Typography by Eric Gill takes the reader back to the have to go 500 years back in time to meet the first one.

## The first transition

A similar conflict emerged after the invention of the first printing knowledge and printed books satisfied this hunger.

*The 42–Line Bible, printed by Gutenberg.*

But, through this transition, the book lost a large part of its the remains of the craftsmanship that went almost extinct in the times of Eric Gill.

## The digital age

The first transition took away a large part of humanity from written basic ones, and trash the rest.

Typography is not about typefaces. It’s not about what looks best, Russian typographer, put it.

## Loss of humanity through transitions

Each transition took away a part of humanity from written language. still don’t spot it in the street.

Typefaces don’t look handmade these days. And that’s all right. They it isn’t.

We’ve come close to “perfection” in the last five centuries. The letters are crisp and without rough edges. We print our compositions with high–precision printers on a high quality, machine made paper.

*Type through 5 centuries.*

We lost a part of ourselves because of this chase after perfection. There’s no more “why” behind the “what”.

## Chasing perfection

Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will typography. It might be the last part. Are we really going to give it up?
